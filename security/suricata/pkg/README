| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting suricata
=================

For normal use, you need to set first your interface and enable the
daemon:

# rcctl enable suricata
# rcctl set suricata flags -i em0

And you need the rules, these rules are expected to be present in the
${SYSCONFDIR}/suricata/rules directory as defined in
${SYSCONFDIR}/suricata/suricata.yaml.

Rule management
===============

Oinkmaster
----------

It is possible to download and install rules manually, but there is a
much easier and quicker way to do so. There are special programs which
you can use for downloading and installing rules. There is for example
Pulled Pork and Oinkmaster. In this documentation the use of Oinkmaster
will be described.

# pkg_add oinkmaster

There are several rulesets. There is for example Emerging Threats (ET)
Emerging Threats Pro and VRT. In this example we are using Emerging
Threats.

Oinkmaster has to know where the rules an be found. These rules can be
found at:

http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata/emerging.rules.tar.gz

And you can download as follow:

# cd /etc && oinkmaster -C ${SYSCONFDIR}/oinkmaster.conf -o ${SYSCONFDIR}/suricata/rules

Finally you can restart Suricata to pick up the new rules:

# rcctl restart suricata
