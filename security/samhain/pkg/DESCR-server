Samhain is an open source file integrity and host-based intrusion
detection system for Linux and Unix. It can run as a daemon process,
and and thus can remember file changes - contrary to a tool that runs
from cron, if a file is modified you will get only one report, while
subsequent checks of that file will ignore the modification as it is
already reported (unless the file is modified again).

This package contains the server parts.

Available flavors:
	mysql - build with support for MySQL
	pgsql - build with support for PostgreSQL
