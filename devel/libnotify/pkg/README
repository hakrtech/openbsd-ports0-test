To be able to display popup notifications one of the following
notification daemons needs to be installed:

    * notification-daemon
    * xfce4-notifyd
    * notification-daemon-xfce (deprecated)

Note that some Desktop Environments (e.g. GNOME with gnome-shell) use
their own notification daemon in which case it is not necessary to
install another one.
