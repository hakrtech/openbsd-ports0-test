Use within a chroot jail
========================

Under OpenBSD, the default Apache runs chrooted under /var/www.
To use the rrdtool(1) binary from within this chroot (for example, as
needed by some CGI/PHP scripts), we will need to copy it into the chroot
along with the required libraries and configuration.
To do so, run the following command:

    # ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/rrdtool/rrdtool-chroot

Note that you will have to run this command again when the rrdtool
package is updated.
