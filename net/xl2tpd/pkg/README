| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

This port is in early stages, and in general for LNS use it is
recommended to use npppd(8) instead, however it is useful if you wish
to use OpenBSD as an L2TP client (LAC).

Normally, xl2tpd would be controlled by using xl2tpd-control, a dedicated
program. This currently requires functions not present in OpenBSD, however
all this does is write simple commands to a fifo (you may be familiar with
this style from isakmpd). You can use the following as an alternative:

  echo '[command] [config_name]' > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control

Where [command] is one of:

  c    connect; may be followed by authname and password
  d    disconnect
  r    (disconnect and) remove

You must send the 'c'onnect command to actually bring up a session;
configuring it and starting the daemon is not sufficient.

xl2tpd makes a connection via L2TP, but uses pppd(8) to carry out most
operations; therefore any PPP-related configuration is done via pppd.
Also note that a free ppp(4) interface must exist before xl2tpd brings
up a connection; you could create an /etc/hostname.ppp0 file simply
containing the word "up".
