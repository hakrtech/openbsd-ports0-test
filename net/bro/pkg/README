| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that most broctl(8) commands must be run as root.

Post-install steps
==================

Before starting bro(8) for the first time, the "interface" must be properly
configured under:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/bro/node.cfg

And the configuration and policies must be installed by running:
    broctl install

File descriptors limit
======================

Both bro(8) and broctl(8) need to bump their nofile limits.

bro(8)
------
The following lines can be added to login.conf(5):

	bro:\
		:openfiles-cur=1024:\
		:tc=daemon:

Then the login.conf.db can be rebuilt file if necessary:
        [ -f /etc/login.conf.db ] && cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

broctl(8)
---------
Some subcommands like "deploy" may require more file descriptors.
e.g.
    ulimit -n 512; broctl deploy
