+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

puppetboard has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

Please be aware that this is still highly experimental software and
may not be production ready.

Configuration
-------------
You can configure the PuppetDB host and port through
${INSTDIR}/puppetboard/default_settings.py
Please note that there is currently no SSL support. It is therefore
recommended you run puppetboard on the same host as PuppetDB is running.

PuppetDB
--------
Puppetboard will only function when PuppetDB is available. PuppetDB
can be installed with:

    pkg_add puppetdb

Starting puppetboard
--------------------

Puppetboard can be started by appending something along these lines to
/etc/rc.local:

    cd ${INSTDIR} && \
    ${LOCALBASE}/bin/gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:80 --bind \[::1\]:80 \
        --daemon --workers 4 wsgi:application
