Middleware layer
================

In order to use MCollective a middleware layer needs to be present
inside the network. While RabbitMQ is supported, it is advised to use
ActiveMQ. The packages can be installed with their respective commands:

    # pkg_add apache-activemq
or
    # pkg_add rabbitmq

Configuration
=============

For more information on configuring and running MCollective, please
