| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUT is split into separate components. A hardware driver interfaces
with the device and sends information to upsd. A monitor (upsmon)
connects to upsd and shuts down the machine when necessary.

These components can reside on separate computers (i.e. UPS monitored
by various computers may communicate with a central upsd, and a whole
network may run upsmon to allow for shutdown).

On OpenBSD, daemons are usually started by adding to the pkg_scripts
variable in /etc/rc.conf.local. For NUT, machines running upsd or
the hardware driver should include "upsd" in this line, and all
machines should include "upsmon". Where you run both, upsd should
be started first. For example you could use this line:

	pkg_scripts="upsd upsmon [...any other daemons...]"

Device permissions
==================
For locally connected UPS devices, the userid running NUT (normally
${NUT_USER}) must have access to the relevant device nodes.

RS232: Either add ${NUT_USER} to group "dialer" or change the group
ownership of the relevant /dev/tty* device to ${NUT_USER}.

USB: Change the group of the relevant /dev/ugen* and /dev/usb* devices
to ${NUT_USER}; to identify the specific controller and ugen device
names, use "sudo usbdevs -vd".

Network devices
===============
To reduce dependencies for the basic NUT package, support for network
devices has been split into subpackages. Separate packages are provided
for SNMP-based devices, and for Eaton/MGE devices using an XML/HTTP
protocol. Install these with pkg_add if wanted:

# pkg_add nut-snmp
# pkg_add nut-xml

Configuration sections can be automatically generated for various
device types (network/USB) using the nut-scanner tool. This is in the
main nut package but picks up dependencies at runtime, so if you wish
to scan for network devices, just make sure the relevant package
is installed before you run the scanner.

To scan for network devices, specify start and end IP addresses:

# nut-scanner -s 192.168.17.1 -e 192.168.17.20
