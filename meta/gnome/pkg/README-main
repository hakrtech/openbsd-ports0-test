| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The GNOME desktop is composed of 2 meta-packages:
    * gnome, for a base GNOME installation
    * gnome-extras, for a full GNOME installation
They are focused on standard usage (i.e. accessibility, development, and
office type packages are left out on purpose).

Starting GNOME
==============
Before running gnome-session(1), a system-wide D-Bus daemon needs to be
running ("dbus_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
in rc.conf.local(8)).

Then the following line needs to be added:
    exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gnome-session
in ~/.xinitrc when using startx(1) (console login)
in ~/.xsession when using xdm(1) (X Display Manager login)

Default limits
==============
GNOME can be hungry on file descriptors due to kqueue(2) based file
monitoring, usage of the webkit toolkit... While not mandatory, it is
advised to bump the "openfiles" limit up to 512.
More info is available in the README of the glib2 package under
    ${LOCALBASE}/share/doc/pkg-readmes

An alternative solution to using login.conf(5) and users class is to add
the following line before gnome-session(1) is called:
    ulimit -Sn 512

mDNS/DNS-SD support
===================
The avahi-daemon(8) daemon provides Zeroconf support (aka. Bonjour /
Rendezvous) in GNOME. Several applications can optionally benefit from
it (e.g. the "Network" shortcut in nautilus(1)) while some others
will not work at all without it (e.g. seahorse-sharing(1)).

To make use of it, rc.conf.local(5) needs to contain the following line:
    multicast_host=YES
and "avahi_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
_after_ "dbus_daemon".

A note about accessibility
==========================
Dependency on a11y packages is never enforced so to activate an
assistive technology you need to explicitely install the corresponding
packages:
    * mousetweaks - mouse accessibility enhancements
    * orca - assistive technology for visually impaired
