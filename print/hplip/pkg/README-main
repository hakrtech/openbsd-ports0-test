| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Communication with the printer is done via CUPS over libusb, make sure
you read the "USB" section of the pkg-readmes documentation that comes
with the cups package.

To add a CUPS printer, run the following command as root:
(hp-setup needs both the CUPS and DBus daemons running)
    hp-setup -i

Plugin installation
===================
Some printers will not work properly without a corresponding proprietary
binary plugin. HPLIP plugins automated installation using HPLIP is not
available on OpenBSD but it can be installed manually by running the
following as root:

    cd /tmp
    ftp http://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/hplip-${V}-plugin.run
    /bin/sh ./hplip-${V}-plugin.run --keep 2>/dev/null
    ${MODPY_BIN} ./plugin_install.py -i
