The GNOME Shell extension design is designed to give a high degree of
power to the parts of the GNOME interface managed by the shell, such as
window management and application launching. It simply loads arbitrary
JavaScript and CSS. This gives developers a way to make many kinds of
changes and share those changes with others, without having to patch the
original source code and recompile it, and somehow distribute the
patched code. The extension system is a replacement for the "applets" or
"widgets" system of GNOME 2.
